# Darshan in Hinduism

> In judgement, the world is divided: good and bad, innocent and guilty, polluted and pure, oppressor and oppressed, privileged and unprivileged, powerful and powerless. In darshan, one sees a fluid world of cause and consequence, where there are no divisions, boundaries, hierarchies or rules.

> It is not the violence that bothers him(Arjuna); he has killed before. What bothers him is violence against family, those he is meant to protect.

Arjuna is standing in battlefield, hesitant to use violence against his own family. Before and after Gita, he has used violence. He is only hesitant to use violence against his family. If he considers only those in that battlefield as his family, does he have darshan? Because in darshan

>In darshan, there is no judgement because there are no boundaries, no rules, no separation of right and wrong, mine and not mine.

> Dhritarashtra is unable to do darshan because of memories (smriti); 
> Arjuna also has many reasons not to do darshan:

Memories of past injustices should be forgotten to attain darshan.
