This is where we are, my love
Impaled by the loneliness of our togetherness 

In a room
When air around me has disappeared 
Drowning in the oppression of night ear to ear
Cut by moonlight
a steel so cold, that
My courage bleeds more than the wound.

Let us sheath the sharpened inconveniences 
It is easier this way
We be phantoms
Show ourselves in each other's hallucinations
Sleep in the cocoons of our mirages
For if we wake up
Slippery footholds of teasing hopes may abandon us
Frost-bitten memory of our longing may fade
The spring may die.

Dr. Rizwan Ishak
