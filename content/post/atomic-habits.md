## Chapter 1

- Effect of small habits compund over time. In order to understand their effect, you need to track them over a period of weeks or months.
  - Inability to appreciate this fact makes us ignore good small habits and let small bad habits slide.
  - Think of small habits like small change in the degree of direction an aeroplane. It will have a huge impact over its course and ultimately change where it ends up.
- Breakthrough moments will come only after repeating small habits for long enough. If you are expecting them to happen immediately, you will be disappointed. Be patient and focus on your steps.
- In the course of developing a habit, one should expect to find himself in a valley of disappointment and boredom at some point. It is due to expectation of linear progress which is not real. Understand that progress comes in a step ladder fashion. Persist.
- Forget goals, focus on systems
  - Everyone wants success. Even those who have the same clear cut goals don't always succeed often. Use goals to set direction of your systems. After that, focus on the system.
  - Ideally: One should internalize our goals. Our goal should be to acquire knowledge, not do well in exams, act with integrity, not earn respect.
  - What is a system? A system is a collection of habits and tasks you complete that improve you.
  - In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.”
- Problems with goals
  - Winners and losers have the same goals. Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias.
  - Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. You will fall back into your old lifestyle after achieving goals.
  - The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.
  - Goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you achieve your goal and are successful or you fail and you are a disappointment.

## Chapter 2

- Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more money, but if your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you’ll continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning.
- The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.
- You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity
  - The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
  - The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
- Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit.
