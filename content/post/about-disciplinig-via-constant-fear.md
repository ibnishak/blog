Dear Riz of Future,

I hope things are fine. This is a note to remind you of one particular things - disciplining your children by constant fear.

Constant fear is oppression. 
1. Oppressors cannot remain in power for eternity. 
1. Oppressed should not love thier oppressors.

So when you grow old and weak, your only hope is that you have broken your kids into a deranged intellectual gymnasts who can love their oppressors. What a sad bunch of humans would that be.
