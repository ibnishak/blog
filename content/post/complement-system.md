- Collection of 20 proteins mainly produced in liver
- C1 from GIT mucosa
- Another source of complement proteins in macrophages

## Classic pathway
- Antigen enters body. Antibody attaches to antigen.
- C1 protein has 3 subdomains Q,R,and S. Q subdomain attach to antibody.
- The order of chain is **Fc of antibody - C1 - C4 - C2 - C3 - C5 - C6-9**
  - C2 to C5 follows Baby with Apple system
  - C5b-C9 is the Membrane attack complex. C5b onwards is _late events_
    - MAC is effective only against Gram negative. Their absence is marked by repeated infection of Neisseria gonorrhea (Gram negative cocci).
-C3b facilities phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages. It is thus an **opsonin**. Another opsonin is IgG which can do the same.


### Requirements for activation of classic pathway
- **Antigen-antibody complexes**
- Antibody must be IgG or IgM (Single IgM or Double IgG)
  - GM Motors makes Classical cars
- IgG subclasses 1-3 will trigger classic pathway, ~~IgG4 will not~~.

### Limitations of Classic pathway and How body overcomes them
- Antibody production could take upto 2 weeks for a brand new antigen. 
- So body started accepting triggers other than antigen-antibody complexes. Lipopolysaccharides of gram negative organims (Alternate pathway) and Mannan protein of gram positive organisms also act as triggers now.

## Alternate Pathway
- Gram negative bacteria has Lipopolysaccharides on their surface
- The order of chain is: **LPS- C3 - Protein-B - C3 - C5 - C6-C9**

## Lectin Pathway
- Gram positive has Mannan protein on surface.
- The order of chain is: **Mannan - MBL - C4 - C2 - C3 - C5 - C6-9**

## More ways to help killing pathogens
- Mast cells are activated by c3a and c5a -> histamine -> vasodilation -> more inflammatory cells to scene. Thus they are anaphylotoxins.
  - Major mast cell activator is IgE
- C5a is a chemotactic agent for neutrophils.
- C5a makes endothelial cells more adhesive to neutrophils.
- Some complement can block viral entry to cells. These viruses are later attached by antibodies and opsonised.
- C3b can induce B cell proliferation -> more antibodies.

## Pathologies of Alternate Pathway
Alternate pathway can also be activated by aggregated IgA complexes. 

- In **Bergers IgA nephropathy**,  IgA deposits on glomerular membrane of kidney -> Compliment system triggered and attacks glomerular membrane

- IgA deposit under skin and GIT mucosa seen in **Dermatitis herpetiformis**.
- IgA deposit on multiple tissues after Viral URTI which liver failed to remove from circulation - **Henoch Schonlein Purpura**
  - 7 yr old with viral URTI  2 wks back. Fever, abdominal cramps, rashes on lower limbs, polyarthritis, proteinuria, generalized lymphadenopathy, pericardial pain.

## Pathologies due to defective complement regulation and deficiencies
- C1 esterase inhibitors inhibit C1 until a threshold amount of antigen is reached to avoid unncessary triggers. 
C1 inhibitors deficiency 
  -> Compliment activation at slightest triggers 
  -> More C3a -> Mast cell activation -> More histamine
  -> Non itchy rashes, edema and bronchoconstriction - **Angioneurotic Edema**. It is called neurotic because sometimes it is precipitated under anxiety.

- Decay acceleration factor (CD55 and CD59) in membranes of RBC, WBC and platelets protects them against complement system by decaying C5 convetase and C3 convertase. DAF is deficient in **Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinurina** resulting in lysis of RBC (Hemoglobinuria), Platelets (Venous thrombosis), and Neutrophils.
- Deficiency of Early Factors (before C5, esp C3): Repeated Staphylococcus infection of sinus.
- Deficiency of Late Factors (esp MAC): Repeated Neisseria infection
- C2 and c4 deficiency: 
  -> No C3 -> No opsonisation
  -> Antigen wanders in blood for more time
  -> More antibodies which eventually attack our tissues --> **SLE**

## Major causes of hypocomplementemia
- Liver disease (Under production)
- SLE (Overuse)
  - If you have glomerulonephritis and low C3, it is probably SLE
- ABO incompatibility
  Donor RBC is considered offending antigen. 
  - Antibodies -> Complement -> C3
  -> Mast cell activation -> Histamine -> _Shock. Bronchoconstriction._
  - Free Hemoglobin filtered through kidneys damaging PCT -> AKI

## C3b Convertase
- In classic pathway, C3b convertase is C4b-C2b
- In alternate pathway, C3b convertase is C3b-Bb
- In Lection pathway, C3b convertase is C4b-C2b 

## Misc 
- Properdin is a positive regulator of C3. 
- H factor and I factor - negative regulator of c3b.
