When you are paragliding, for a few moments you just get to leave everything behind. You are gliding so far above the ground that it is almost as if you are suspended between earth and sky. Beyond being geo-spatially detached, you brain just attains a hyper-focus that you become 'present' - completely unaware of past and future. In this state you are acutely aware of each passing second, and it is one of the best possible time to attain this flow. All around you will be nature in all its glory, from a vantage point unlike any other. Personally, I have never been overwhelmed like that before.
