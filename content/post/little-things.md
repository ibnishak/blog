Mama, take this badge off of me,
I can't use it anymore.
It's gettin' dark... too dark to see,
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
(Robert Allen Zimmerman)

“Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night?
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light.
For the wretched of the earth
There is a flame that never dies.
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise.”
(Victor Hugo, Les Misérables)

I wish myself into your arms,
To know that all I need is everything
(Aztec Camera)

Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
In being so blest! There may be in the cup
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
Is not infected: but if one present
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
With violent hefts. I have drunk, and seen the spider.
(Shakespeare)

Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,
It seems to me most strange that men should fear,
Seeing that death, a necessary end,
Will come when it will come."
(Shakespeare)
