> We	must	also	guard	against	a	masculine	view	of	history	based	on	conflict and	triumph	alone.	This	has	been	popularized	by	Western academics	and	their	love	for	the	Hegelian	dialectic,	where	thesis	creates antithesis	until	there	is	resolution	and	a	new	thesis.	This	approach	assumes	that history	has	a	natural	direction	and	purpose.

> The feminine view of history does not view it as a conflict but as a continuous synthesis. Everything in past influences present, everything in present influences future.

> Here	the	world	has	no	beginning,	no	end,	no	value,	no	purpose.	All	meaning	is created	by	humans,	individually	and	collectively:	the	boundaries	we	establish and	fight over.
