Zettelkasten is a workflow used by [Niklas Luhmann][1]. It is popularized in recent times by [Sohnke Ahren][2]

[Source][4]

1. Import your highlights. Ensure that you add metadata to the top including appropriate tags and source. These are called reference notes. It is like inbox in [GTD workflow][3]
2. Take Literature Notes
      - Summarise
      - Explain idea  enough to stand on its own, without the context of the book or the associated highlight.
      - Note your insights and questions regarding it.
      - Add metadata: Source, Keywords
3. Take Permanent Notes
      - Think how each literature note relates to things you already know. Place it appropriate position in that stream. 
      - Add links to other notes. See Cross-Linking section below. 
      - If this existing permanent note were used to write an article, what information is missing?
      - Write in full sentences.

## Workflow Principles
This is more important than the workflow itself. From time to time, one should check their workflow against these principles. Your workflow should be able to: 

1. Create positive experiences
2. Create Learning
3. KISS: Reduce the number of steps and decisions.
4. Do not attempt to drink the ocean. Filter, simplify and index.
      - Marie Kondo Principle: Keep that which sparks joy. 

## Organizational methods

1. MOC or Map of Contents: This is a note with links to other notes, revolving around a topic. It could be arranged to reflect the hierarchy of notes.
1. Mindmaps: Images to get a birds eye view of the content. It also helps to identify relationships that were not previously obvious. 
1. Alphabetically sorted tags: This is the master list. This exists so that we do not have to depend on memory to see what all have we put into our zettelkasten
1. Unsorted tags: Inorder to add serendipity
1. Links: Links within article helps to develop wider understanding and clear up jargon.
1. Stream: This is a single link to the note that comes immediately after current note. Having this helps not to take shortcuts in the conversation with notes.


## Cross-Linking in Zettelkasten

Source: [Make Your Notes Work for You][5]

- A link to a more general idea. If you’re writing about the diet of guinea pigs you might link to the nutritional requirements of rodents in general.
- A link to a more specific idea. Here you could link to protein requirements of guinea pigs.
- A related topic. This could be a lateral leap — guinea pigs as pets, alternate meanings of “guinea pig”, an article on “is a guinea pig a pig?”

- If I am to write an essay on this topic, what points are missing? Then write those notes and link it.
- What does it relate to is an easier question to answer than where does it belong.


## Why

1. Avoid Collector's fallacy
2. Convert Knowledge to Wisdom, implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge.
3. Better engagement with notes
4. Forces you to write more. Writing is thinking.

## Why not

- It is primarily for those who wish to publish and academicians. Iterating through the notes is good idea always. However it need not follow the zettelkasten steps.
- It creates a lot of pressure on reading
- It is time consuming
- Other than Luhmann himself, no credible example of increased output due to zettelkasten.
- Writing is thinking principle need not apply to all. For some, writing is recording of thinking.
