Zettelkasten is a workflow used by [Niklas Luhmann][1]. It is popularized in recent times by [Sohnke Ahren][2]

[Source][4]

1. Import your highlights. Ensure that you add metadata to the top including appropriate tags and source. These are called reference notes. It is like inbox in [GTD workflow][3]
2. Take Literature Notes
      - Your summary on each highlight. how can I make this idea detailed enough to stand on its own, without the context of the book or the associated highlight?
      - Your insights.
      - The questions arising from it.
3. Take Permanent Notes
      - Think how each literature note relates to things you already know. If it adds any value, expand that note including all relevant information. Coalesce literature notes revolving around the same topic. So each note should revolve around one idea.
      - Add metadata: Source, Keywords and links. 
      - Each unit of this note should be able to form a part of larger essay. So write in full sentences.

## Cross-Linking in Zettelkasten

Source: [Make Your Notes Work for You][5]

- A link to a more general idea. If you’re writing about the diet of guinea pigs you might link to the nutritional requirements of rodents in general.
- A link to a more specific idea. Here you could link to protein requirements of guinea pigs.
- A related topic. This could be a lateral leap — guinea pigs as pets, alternate meanings of “guinea pig”, an article on “is a guinea pig a pig?”

- If I am to write an essay on this topic, what points are missing? Then write those notes and link it.
- What does it relate to is an easier question to answer than where does it belong.


## Why

1. Avoid Collector's fallacy
2. Convert Knowledge to Wisdom, implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge.
3. Better engagement with notes
4. Forces you to write more. Writing is thinking.

## Why not

- It is primarily for those who wish to publish and academicians. Iterating through the notes is good idea always. However it need not follow the zettelkasten steps.
- It creates a lot of pressure on reading
- It is time consuming
- Other than Luhmann himself, no credible example of increased output due to zettelkasten.
