Mind palace is basically a structure you build in your imagination, where you consciously deposit memories and attempt to retrieve them later.

- The more familiar you are with the structure, the more easily you can find what youâ€™re looking for.
- Create vivid mental imageries for things you want to remember. Have those interact with things in your memory palace.
