&lt;p>Knowledge acquisition should come in 2 forms - deliberate and free-flowing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deliberate knowledge acquisition in 3 fields&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Personal: Observe our patterns of behavior, and understand whether or not it aligns with goals one has set for himself. Observing oneself also inevitably brings to light one&amp;rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses, and allows the opportunity to experiment with them.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>[[Journaling]].&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[[Quantified self]].&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[[Mindfulness]]/[[Metacognition]]&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Professional: In real life, one must earn a living. Whether you view your profession in materialistic terms or philosophical terms, It behooves us to do it better. Find your [[Circle of competence]] and expand it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spiritual/Philosophical: Everybody should deal with questions like what is my purpose, what is my life philosophy, and a tangential set of why&amp;rsquo;s. It is not necessary to find answers to these questions. However, completely avoiding tussles with them might lead to finding ourselves having mislived. See [[Living in bad faith]]&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What separates knowledge acquisition different from deliberate knowledge acquisition is the portion of time dedicated to [[Metalearning]]. In addition to acquiring knowledge, one should also evaluate the methods, reasons, and progress of knowledge acquisition ideally at fixed intervals.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
