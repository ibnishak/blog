There are 2 ways information can be organized in a digital system

- Using folders.
- Using tags

The advantage of using folders is the portability of organization. Folders are
a cross platform entity. You can create a folder using any file explorer or in
terminal

The advantage of tags is its fluidity. A note may belong to more than one category. There are two ways to solve this when using folders:

1. Create copies of notes and place them in different category folder. This is just ridiculous. It consumes space, and it burdens the user to update every copy whenever the note is  edited.
2. Using symlinks. Symlinks do not work cross platform, thereby nullifying the advantage of folders.

Tags enable us to forego this need for rigid categorisation. Hierarchies of tags can be build as more and more notes are added to the collection. Thus rather than decide the hierarchies and try to fit the notes into them, you create notes, tag them and decide hierarchies later.
