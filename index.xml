This is great for software development workflow. However if you are using git to version control something like a personal knowledge base, keeping snapshots all the way back to origin is unnecessary.
Git provides facilities to prune old commits. We make use of this facility to keep only last 5 commits.</description></item><item><title>Personal Knowledge Base - Criteria and Candidates</title><link>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/criteria-for-personal-knowledge-base/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/criteria-for-personal-knowledge-base/</guid><description>Essential criteria.
