You are gliding so far above the ground that it is almost as if you are suspended between earth and sky. Beyond being geo-spatially detached, you brain just attains a hyper-focus that you become &amp;lsquo;present&amp;rsquo; - completely unaware of past and future. In this state you are acutely aware of each passing second, and it is one of the best possible time to attain this flow.</description></item><item><title>Limiting Number of Git Revisions-How</title><link>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/limit-number-of-git-revisions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 22:42:40 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/limit-number-of-git-revisions/</guid><description>What Whenever a git commit is made, you are essentially creating a snapshot of the directory tree with some optimisations. This is great for software development workflow. However if you are using git to version control something like a personal knowledge base, keeping snapshots all the way back to origin is unnecessary.
Git provides facilities to prune old commits. We make use of this facility to keep only last 5 commits.</description></item><item><title>Criteria for Personal Knowledge Base</title><link>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/criteria-for-personal-knowledge-base/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Oct 2020 18:46:19 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/criteria-for-personal-knowledge-base/</guid><description>Essential criteria.

Semi automation of organization. Bottom up organization. Fast input. Least effort for initial setup, but extendable according to personal requirements. Ideal criteria Complete portability The question to consider is: &amp;ldquo;If I have to run and all I can take is a pendrive, can I take my pkb with me and how effectively can I use it?</description></item><item><title>Building markor from source code in linux</title><link>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/building-markor-in-linux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/building-markor-in-linux/</guid><description>Markor can be installed from Google playstore, FDroid as well as releases page of this repo. Nevertheless, if you want the cutting edge version, here are the general instructions for Linux platform. Open terminal run the following set of commands one by one.
If you do not have android-sdk installed, you need to install it first. mkdir $HOME/android-sdk-dl if test ! -e $HOME/android-sdk-dl/sdk-tools.zip ; then curl https://dl.google.com/android/repository/sdk-tools-linux-3859397.zip &amp;gt; $HOME/android-sdk-dl/sdk-tools.</description></item><item><title>Vim: Copy and paste to termux clipboard</title><link>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/copy-to-termux-clip/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/copy-to-termux-clip/</guid><description>Copying to system clipboard from vim is usually done by using the &amp;ldquo;+ register. Unfortunately this will not work in termux. Here is a workaround to cut, copy and paste from android clipboard. Remember that you need termux-apk tools for this to work.
Add the following to vimrc vnoremap &amp;lt;C-x&amp;gt; :!termux-clipboard-set&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;vnoremap &amp;lt;C-c&amp;gt; :w !termux-clipboard-set&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;inoremap &amp;lt;C-v&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ESC&amp;gt;:read !termux-clipboard-get&amp;lt;CR&amp;gt;i Source the vimrc or reload vim. In visual mode, you can now use &amp;ldquo;Ctrl-x&amp;rdquo; to cut, &amp;ldquo;Ctrl-c&amp;rdquo; to copy to termux clipboard.</description></item><item><title>Adding custom language highlight and fonts to markor</title><link>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/adding-custom-language-highlight-to-markor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/adding-custom-language-highlight-to-markor/</guid><description>My code blocks do not have syntax highlighting.

The non-conformity of keybindings in emacs is a rather tricky hurdle. While it is accepted that Emacs is practically an operating system and the true emacs-jedi can do everything in Emacs itself, the rest of mortals have to interact with other, normal softwares. Let us consider the simple tasks of cut, copy and paste.</description></item><item><title>Spotting bad ideologies</title><link>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/spotting-bad-ideology/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ibnishak.github.io/blog/post/spotting-bad-ideology/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Doubt each old thing you know.
