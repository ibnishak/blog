Mrazek etal, 2013</a></li><li>The default mode of humans appears to be that of mind-wandering, which correlates with unhappiness, and with activation in a network of brain areas associated with self-referential processing. We investigated brain activity in experienced meditators and matched meditation-naive controls as they performed several different meditations (Concentration, Loving-Kindness, Choiceless Awareness). We found that the <strong>main nodes of the default-mode network (medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) were relatively deactivated in experienced meditators</strong> across all meditation types. Furthermore, functional connectivity analysis revealed <strong>stronger coupling in experienced meditators between the posterior cingulate, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (regions previously implicated in self-monitoring and cognitive control), both at baseline and during meditation.</strong> Our findings demonstrate differences in the default-mode network that are consistent with decreased mind-wandering. - <a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3250176/>Judson A.
