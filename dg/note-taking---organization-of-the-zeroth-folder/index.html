It is named so that it appears first in lists and is easy to <code>cd</code> into. Under <code>~/0</code> there is:</p><p>Three Obsidian vaults.</p><ol><li>Think box<ul><li>For thinking, deliberating opinions, and questioning myself</li><li>Daily routines and situational routines, mental models.</li><li>Notes on people.</li><li>Managing my lists (from ranked list of atrocities committed by governments to alphabetically sorted list of friends I would prefer as neighbors).</li><li>Highlights from Books (Moon reader) and Articles (Scrap bee).</li></ul></li><li>Digital Fortress<ul><li>Workflows, Criteria</li><li>Links to Resources.</li><li>Tutorials</li><li>Code snippets.

However overtime I have found that these three areas have very little overlap<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. Splitting this way also helps me to monitor the growth of these three areas separately, however crude a measure that may be.</p><p>Within these vaults, I do not usually divide notes into folders. I found that creating index files is far more flexible than folders. In addition, I like the simplicity of linking by wrapping with double brackets without worrying about the paths. While Obsidian has magic configs that allow this even if the notes are in a separate folder, taking that route will restrict me to Obsidian.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Very little does not mean zero. For e.g. &ldquo;List of FOSS alternatives&rdquo; go to Digital Fortress, while &ldquo;Ethics of FOSS&rdquo; goes to Think Box. All the more reason to keep splits to minimum.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><div class=comments></div></article></body><div class=foot>&copy; 2019 - 2024 &#183;
