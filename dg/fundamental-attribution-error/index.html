After just fifteen minutes of play for each game, the researchers began noticing behavioral changes in the advantaged players - ranging from louder, more forceful movement of their game piece (and other “displays of power”) to seemingly trivial things like eating more pretzels.</p><p>In one humorously shocking example, one of the advantaged players, after successfully winning the game, was heard explaining what he had done, strategically, to succeed and win. He could rationalize that his win was due to his own actions. This example speaks to how we make sense of advantage.</p><div class=comments></div></article></body><div class=foot>&copy; 2019 - 2024 &#183;
